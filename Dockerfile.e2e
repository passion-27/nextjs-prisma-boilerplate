# this Dockerfile is needed because of @testing-library/cypress
# import in tests-e2e/cypress/support/commands.js
# must be in root to include prisma
# must include all imports from seed: prisma, bcryptjs, faker, next.js...

# 2x smaller size than 16.3 which is in project
FROM cypress/base:16.14.2

# add prisma and generate client for seed

# by setting CI environment variable we switch the Cypress install messages
# to small "started / finished" and avoid 1000s of lines of progress messages

# verify that Cypress has been installed correctly.
# running this command separately from "cypress run" will also cache its result
# to avoid verifying again when running the tests
RUN npx cypress verify
